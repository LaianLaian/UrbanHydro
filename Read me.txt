This repository contains all codes and relevant resources used in the manuscript "Peri-urban vegetation-induced evapotranspiration fuels urban precipitation". The entire analytical workflow is organized into four sequential steps:

Step 1: Trend Analysis and Placebo Test
Main script:Step1_compute_Pur_LAIvi_Trends_PlaceboTest.m
Purpose:
Calculates linear trends and significance (p-values) of annual urban precipitation (Pur; Fig. 1a) and peri-urban LAI (LAIperi; Fig. 1b) from 2000 to 2021.
Performs placebo tests (Fig.1d) to assess the empirical significance of LAI–precipitation linkages using 1,000 randomized permutations.
Output:
Excel files containing trend estimates, p-values, and placebo test results.

Step 2: ET Modeling and Vegetation-Induced Differences
① Step2_PTJPLim_Model/
Contains MATLAB implementation of the improved Priestley–Taylor Jet Propulsion Laboratory model (PT-JPLim) for global evapotranspiration (ET) estimation.
ET components estimated:
Interception evaporation (Ei)
Soil evaporation (Es)
Transpiration (Et)
Urban evaporation (Eu)

② Step2_Results_ETperi_diff/
Contains annual vegetation-induced ET differences in peri-urban areas (ETperi_diff), calculated as the difference between real- and fixed-vegetation scenarios using ArcGIS Zonal Statistics.

③ Step2_compute_ETperidiff_Trends.m
Converts PT-JPLim results to 0.05° spatial resolution (Fig.2a).
Computes temporal trends and statistical significance of ETperi_diff (Fig.2b).
Output:
Excel files summarizing annual ETperi_diff values and their trends.

Step 3: Moisture Transport via UTrack Model
Input references:
city_latlon.xlsx: Latitude and longitude of 1,029 cities
Step3_ID_ORIG.xlsx: Mapping between city ID and peri-urban area ID

① Step3_UtrackModel_annual.py
Processes 12-month climatology files per city to compute annual average source contributions of precipitation.

② Step3_UtrackModel_monthly.py
Similar to above but retains monthly resolution for temporal analysis.

③ Step3_UtrackModel_resample.py
Resamples UTrack outputs from 0.5° to 0.05° spatial resolution via bilinear interpolation.
Performs normalization to conserve total moisture contribution.

④ Step3_compute_Purdiff_Trends_Pidiff_Cvege.m
Uses UTrack model outputs to compute:
Pur_diff: Precipitation change attributed to vegetation-driven ET and moisture transport (Fig. 3a)
Trends and p-values of Pur_diff (Fig. 3b)
Pi_diff: Normalized Pur_diff as % of baseline precipitation (Fig. 3c)
Cvege: Contribution of vegetation-induced change to total precipitation trend (Fig. 3d)
Output:
Excel files with multi-metric city-level indicators.

Step 4: Urban Classification and Group-wise Analysis
① compute_ΔLAI-wind direction coherence.py
Analyzes coherence between spatial LAI trends and dominant wind directions.

② compute_Vegetation structure continuity.py
Computes vegetation structure continuity using a fragmentation index (Structural Integrity Index) from LAI spatial patterns.

③ Step4_Groups.xlsx
Records the classification of all cities into ten categories based on ΔLAI–wind coherence, vegetation structure, and resulting Pi_diff metrics.
Fields include:
City ID, Pi_diff, Areal Pi_diff, and classification category.

④ Step4_compute_City_group_tests.m
Conducts group-wise statistical tests for Pi_diff across different city types.
Output:
Summary statistics written to Excel (used for Fig. 4 panels).
